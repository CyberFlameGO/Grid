This source code is provided as a code sample and to allow other to see how Grid was developed.  Please note that many integral packages have been removed from this sample, and therefore it will not compile or run.  Additionally, some code has been removed (and marked as such) in some of the remaining classes.

Use and/or redistribution of Grid, any of its components, or any derivative of it (including but not limited to its code and design) is strictly forbidden.  The availability of this source code shall not confer a license to use Grid or any part of it.
